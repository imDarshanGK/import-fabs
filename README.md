math.fabs(x)

*Input:Real number

*Return Type: Floating-point number

This function returns the absolute value of the number given as an argument. By absolute, we mean that if the number is -5 it would become positive i.e.5.

The number on the left side of the origin on the x-axis becomes positive i.e it gets multiplied by -1 when returned. Example, math.fabs(-5.4) = ((-1)x(-5.4))=5.4

solution:

     13.4
